**Live Site:** https://shubhthekings.github.io/portfolio/

## 💡 What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me:

1. **Responsive Design**: Using CSS Grid and Flexbox to create layouts that work 
   from mobile (320px) to 4K displays

2. **JavaScript Animations**: Implemented typing effects, scroll animations, and 
   interactive project filtering without any frameworks

3. **Performance Optimization**: Used IntersectionObserver API for lazy loading 
   and scroll animations, achieving 95+ Lighthouse score

4. **Design Systems**: Created a cohesive visual language with CSS variables, 
   making it easy to maintain consistent colors and spacing

5. **Storytelling**: Learning to present technical projects in a way that shows 
   impact, not just features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Custom animations, gradients, responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks needed!
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting with SSL
- **Font Awesome** - Icons

## 🎯 What Makes It Special

- 8 real-world projects (all deployed/functional)
- Interactive project filtering
- Animated skill bars
- Typing effect showing different roles
- Particle background effects
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Easter egg (Konami Code!) 🎮

## 🌟 Highlights

My favorite part is how I combined my background in agriculture (family onion 
export business) with cutting-edge tech. The Farmer Mitra AI project and 
Airvata Robot show how technology can help rural India.
