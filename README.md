## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Shubham Gangurde**, a passionate Computer Engineer specializing in:
- ☁️ **AWS Cloud & DevOps** (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform)
- 🤖 **AI & Smart Agriculture** (Building solutions that help farmers)
- 💻 **Full-Stack Development** (React, Java, Python, JavaScript)
- 🔧 **IoT & Robotics** (Arduino, ROS, Autonomous Systems)

Currently working as a **Trainee AWS Cloud Engineer** at Cravita Technologies and managing my family's onion export business on the side!

## 🎯 What Makes This Portfolio Special

### 💖 Personality & Vibe (UwU Category)
- **My Story**: I blend traditional agriculture (family business) with cutting-edge tech
- **Fun Facts**: Built a farm robot for ₹45K (10x cheaper!), created a MetaHuman of myself, manage onion exports while coding
- **Easter Eggs**: Try the Konami Code! (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA)
- **Color Scheme**: Purple-pink gradient representing innovation + passion

### 🚀 Technical Excellence (Builds FTW / Most Likely to Get Hired)
- **Real Impact**: All 8 projects are deployed/functional, not just demos
- **Business Results**: HSC Cooler website generated actual sales
- **Innovation**: Farmer Mitra AI uses RAG + LLMs for rural farmers
- **Cloud Skills**: Live EC2 deployment with LEMP stack

### 😎 Unique Features (Main Character Energy)
- **Typing Animation**: Cycles through my roles
- **Project Filtering**: Filter by AI/IoT, Web, Cloud
- **Animated Skill Bars**: Shows proficiency levels
- **Particle Effects**: Dynamic hero section
- **Back-to-Top Button**: Smooth navigation
- **Mobile-First**: Perfect on all devices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Custom animations, gradients, flexbox/grid
- **JavaScript** - Vanilla JS (no frameworks needed!)
- **Font Awesome** - Icons
- **Google Fonts** - Poppins typeface

### Deployment
- **GitHub Pages** (Free hosting with SSL)
- **Custom Domain** (Optional)
- **Git** for version control

## 📚 What I Learned

### 1. **Design Systems**
Creating a consistent color scheme with CSS variables made styling 10x easier:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #6366f1;
    --gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #6366f1 0%, #ec4899 100%);
}
```

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Used `IntersectionObserver` API for scroll animations (better than scroll listeners!)
- Lazy loading images for faster initial load
- Minimal dependencies (no heavy libraries)

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Semantic HTML5 tags (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast colors (WCAG AA compliant)

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- Flexible layouts that adapt from 320px to 4K

### 5. **JavaScript Best Practices**
- Event delegation for better performance
- Debouncing scroll events
- Clean, modular code structure
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals)

### 6. **Storytelling Through Design**
- Hero section immediately shows personality
- Project descriptions focus on **impact**, not just features
- Visual hierarchy guides visitors through my journey
